My name is Iván Grijalva. I studied system engineering at Galileo University, with a lot of seduction from math along the way. For a while I was studying abstract algebra, topology, analysis and differential geometry, but ultimately my primary interests are artificial intelligence, block-chain and high performance computing.

I am interested in how the algorithms that perform well in AI can be explained in a mathematical way an how this can be help to improve all the current techniques.  I am wondering if our believe that always there is a neural network that can solve certain problem is equivalent to the Hilbet's program. When the Kurt Gödel of AI will come and what is the equivalence of incompleteness theorem.
