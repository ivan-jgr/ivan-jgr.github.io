My name is Iván Grijalva. I studied system engineering at Galileo University, with a lot of seduction from math along the way. For a while, I was studying abstract algebra, topology, analysis, and differential geometry but ultimately my primary interests are artificial intelligence, blockchain, and high-performance computing.

I’m interested in how the algorithms that perform well in AI can be explained mathematically and how this can help to improve all the current techniques. Some of my work in deep learning consists of CNN for biomedical images, generative models, and representation learning theory.

I’m also interested in Information Theory & Data Science.
