My name is Iván Grijalva. I studied computer science at Galileo University where I fell in love with math along the way. Along with my CS courses y studied abstract algebra, topology, analysis, and differential geometry but ultimately my primary interests are deep learning, blockchain, and high-performance computing.

I’m interested in how the algorithms that perform well in AI can be explained mathematically and how this can help to improve all the current techniques. Some of my work in deep learning consists of CNN for biomedical images, generative models, and representation learning theory.

I’m also interested in Information Theory & Data Science.
